# What is Daylighting?
    - ""Good to show a concrete example of daylighting""
    - [[ Introduce EMPAC ]]
    - ""Entire building is covered in windows""
    - North Facing Windows

# What is Daylighting?
    - Daylit and Geo for pleasing visual + productive envir
    - Envir sustainability 4 green buildings + (reduce carbon footprint)
    - Economic choice save $ and up worker productivity
    - ""Using daylight a means to met an architectural purpose""

# Benefits of Daylighting
    - [[Read what is on slide]]

# Vitamin D
    - [[ why we need vitamin D ]]
    - mineralization of bone
    - softening of bones
    - rickets : poor bone mineralization + prone fractures

    - [[ how do we get vitamin D ]]
    - skin + UVB light ( most ppl )
    - specific foods (fish,mushroom,liver)
    - supplements

    - [[ why are we not getting the D?]]
    - indoor lifestyle
    - SPF products 
    - ""sunscreen of SPF 15 blocks 99% UVB""

    [[ daylighting and the D ]]
    - access to daylight means more vitamin D

# Cird. Photobiology
    - hormonal and behavioral changes throughout 24-hour cycle
    - [[ try not to sing this ]]
    - suprachiasmatic nucleus of the Hyop-thalamus
    - relies on input from non-cone/rod photo-receptors
    - respond to periods of light/dark

    - [[Built for daylight not eletrical]]

    - higher lux (10-100 thousand lux) vs (322 lux)

    - wider spectrum (require shortwave length to regulate melatonin)
        - alert
        - temp regulation 
        - blood pressure

    - times of light/dark
        - sleep/wake cycles
        - when melatonin supression is triggered (morning light)
        - all nighters kill this cycle
            - jet lag

# Increased Productivity
    - Our visual system suited for daylight (color rendering)
    - Lighting systems to emulate this but are costly
    - Windows give information about the outside
    - Envoke feeling of importance
    - Increase worker satification

# Reduced Energy Demands
    - alternative or supplement to electrical lighting 
    - mention that daylight does _not_ mean saved money
    - lighting accounts for 25-40% building energy
    - 52% on wall near window
    - windows can hurt
        - solar heat gain
        - thermal loss
    - shallow sun during the winter vs summer
    - heat a space with solar heat gain 
    - daylight management required
    - people might not like auto-daylight managment


# Challenges Of Designing Daylighting Systems
    - [[ Just go through the slides ]]

# Adverse Daylighting Effects (Occupants)
    - Under illumination
        - reduce contrast of images
        - OSHA set standards (322 lux)
        - hallways have less

    - Glare
        - reduce contast
        - hard because view point dependent
        - discomfort glare vs disability glare vs vailed reflections


# Adverse Daylighting Effects (Economic)
    - solar heat gain up temp
    - thermal loss from windows
        - drapes + shutter
    - occupant behavior


# Architectural Design Processes
    - Talk briefly about the schematic design
    - Talk briefly about design development
    - Talk about how daylighting analysis is usually pushed back design development

# Daylighting In The Early Design Phase (rules of thumb)
    - Elongate building east-west
    - North windows are best 
    - Daylight Zone Measurements
    - Computers perpendicular so less glare
    - Visual task near windows
